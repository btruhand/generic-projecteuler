# Project Euler

These are generic functions written in Python and tested on Python3 for [ProjectEuler] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
By "generic" I mean these are functions you will likely need over and over when solving these project euler questions. You may also find them useful for other purposes.
